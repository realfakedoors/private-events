This is an app similar to a private version of EventBrite (www.eventbrite.com), with user-created events and invitations.

This project is meant to reinforce understanding of associations between models in Rails.

Users can create events and invite other users as guests.

This app is very bare-bones, but styling or authentication could easily be added if necessary.
